Original Strategy:
1. Set a Clear Vision: Start by creating a clear vision for your future, including who you want to be, what you want to do for work, where you want to live, and what your ideal day looks like. This will help provide a foundation for your goals and prioritize your tasks.
2. Identify Lever-Moving Tasks: Determine the three priority tasks that will have the most impact on your goals. These tasks should be focused on writing content, generating traffic, and promoting your products. These tasks will form the core of your work and should be given the most attention and effort.
3. Time Blocking and Breaks: Schedule your work in 90-minute blocks, with 45 minutes dedicated to focused work on each priority task. Set a timer for each block and eliminate distractions during this time. After each 90-minute block, take a break to realign and refocus before moving on to the next task.
4. Manipulate Deadlines: Use deadlines to narrow your attention and increase focus. Set deadlines for specific tasks or projects, and use them as challenges to motivate yourself to complete the work within the designated time frame. Consider using public deadlines or tangible consequences to hold yourself accountable and ensure timely completion.
5. Manipulate Your Environment: Create an environment that is conducive to focused work. Set up a dedicated workspace that is free from distractions and interruptions. Establish a routine that prepares you for work, such as brushing your teeth, making coffee, and getting straight into work. Eliminate any potential distractions, such as turning off notifications on your phone or blocking certain websites during work hours.
6. Prioritize Clarity: Spend time each week generating clarity on your tasks and goals. Use weekends to outline your newsletters, plan your week, and generate ideas for content. Take walks or engage in activities that help clear your mind and generate new ideas. Clarity is essential for maintaining focus and productivity.
7. Evolve and Refine: Continuously evaluate and refine your productivity system. Test different strategies, tools, and techniques to find what works best for you. Be open to adapting and evolving your system as needed to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Regularly review and update your vision to ensure alignment with your goals and desired lifestyle.

The early morning hours, such as 5 to 7 am, can provide a peaceful and distraction-free environment for deep work. Use this time to tackle priority tasks or engage in creative activities that require focus.
9. Prioritize Rest: Recognize the importance of quality rest for maintaining productivity. Rest should involve activities that regenerate mental energy and take your focus off work. Engage in non-work related activities such as going to the gym, taking walks, socializing with friends, reading, or pursuing hobbies. Rest should not be limited to self-care activities but should focus on activities that rejuvenate your mental energy.
10. Make Your Process More Efficient: Continuously work on improving the efficiency of your work process. Use creativity and systemization to solve problems and streamline your workflow. Embrace creative problem-solving by allowing your mind to wander and be open to insights and ideas that can improve your work efficiency. Leverage digital tools and automation software to simplify tasks and save time. Consider using tools like email sequences, scheduling software, and project management systems to optimize your workflow.
11. Leverage Digital Tools: Take advantage of the digital tools available to automate and streamline tasks. Invest in automation software or tools that can make your business processes more efficient. For example, use email sequences to automate sales outreach, schedule content using social media management tools, and utilize project management systems to streamline collaboration and task management. These tools can help you optimize your work and save time.
